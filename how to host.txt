Steps to Host a Minecraft Server

1. Setup Your Minecraft Server:
   Ensure your server files (like `server.jar` for Minecraft) are correctly set up in the `/workspaces/minecraft-PP20MC-2b2t` directory. If you're using YML scripts, they might be automation scripts for setup and management.

2. Install Prerequisites:
   Ensure you have the required software installed, like:
   - Java: Minecraft servers typically run on Java. Make sure the correct version is installed.
     ```
     java -version
     ```
   - Bash: Your scripts seem to use bash, so make sure your environment supports it.

3. Configure `main_host.yml`:
   If this YAML file is related to server hosting, ensure it's properly configured. It might include settings for:
   - Server IP
   - Port forwarding
   - Memory allocation
   - Server properties like max-players, difficulty, etc.

4. Launch the Server in Two Terminals:

   Terminal 1: Start the Hosting Process
   Open the first terminal and run:
   cd /workspaces/minecraft-PP20MC-2b2t bash main_host.yml
   
   Terminal 2: Start the Minecraft Server
   Open the second terminal and run:
   cd /workspaces/minecraft-PP20MC-2b2t bash main_start_server.yml

5. Access the Minecraft Server:
- Local Access: If you're running the server on your local machine, open Minecraft, go to "Multiplayer", and connect using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
- Remote Access: If you're hosting the server remotely (e.g., on a VPS), use your public IP address and ensure port forwarding is set up.

6. Additional Considerations:
- Firewall Settings: Ensure that the required port (default Minecraft port: 25565) is open in your firewall.
- Network Setup: If you're running the server on a different machine, you may need to configure port forwarding on your router.

Save the File: Once you've pasted the instructions, save the file:
Press Ctrl + O to save.
Press Enter to confirm the filename.
Press Ctrl + X to exit.
